# Mistral

Shows how much you spent and how many tokens you used in **Mistral Vibe** today, next to yesterday. ClaudeBar has no source for Mistral's rate limits or plan quota, so there's no percentage or reset time, only daily spend and tokens.

## Setup

1. Use Mistral Vibe at least once, so it has written session logs to `~/.vibe/logs/session/`.
2. Settings → Providers → Mistral → turn it on. It is off by default.
3. Keep Settings → General → **Daily Usage Cards** on (the default). Mistral's numbers only appear in those cards.

No key, no network access and no permission prompts: ClaudeBar only reads the local log files.

## Gotchas

- **Only Vibe is counted.** Le Chat and the Mistral API used from other tools (OpenCode and the like) don't write Vibe logs, so their usage is missing. For account-wide spend, use the Mistral console.
- **Empty card with Daily Usage Cards off.** With the setting off, Mistral shows no numbers at all, because it has no quota bars.
- **ClaudeBar treats Mistral as unavailable until `~/.vibe/logs/session/` exists**, so it stays empty on a Mac where Vibe was never run.
- **A session counts on the day it started.** A session that begins before midnight and runs past it is counted entirely in the earlier day.
- **Cost is Vibe's own number** (`session_cost` in each session's `meta.json`). ClaudeBar doesn't apply its own pricing, so if Vibe's cost is off, ClaudeBar's is too.
- Session folders whose `meta.json` is missing or unreadable are skipped without an error.

## Multiple accounts
